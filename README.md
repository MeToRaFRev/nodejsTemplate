This is a basic Express.js application template with logging, environment variable support, and optional HTTPS support.

  

## Features

  

- Express.js for handling HTTP requests

- Winston for logging

- dotenv for environment variable management

- Automatic detection and use of HTTPS if certificate files are present

- Structured project layout for scalability

## Getting Started

  

### Prerequisites

  

- Node.js installed on your machine

- npm (Node Package Manager)

  

### Generation

  

1. Download the release version `setup.ps1`.

2. Run the following command:

  

```powershell

.\setup.ps1 -name express-app

```

  

### Installation

  

1. Generate/Clone the project files.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the dependencies:

  

```bash

npm  install

```

  

### Running the Application

  

1. Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root of the project with any necessary environment variables. For example:

  

```

KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password

```

  

2. If you want to use HTTPS, place your `cert.pem` and `key.pem` files in the `certs` directory.

  

3. Start the application:

  

```bash

npm start

```

  

The application will start on port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS if the certificate files are present. The server will be accessible at `http://0.0.0.0` or `https://0.0.0.0` respectively.

  

### Available Routes

  

-  `GET /` - Returns "Hello, World!"

-  `POST /data` - Accepts JSON data and returns it

  

### Logging

  

Logs are written to the console and to a `combined.log` file in the root directory using Winston.

  

### Error Handling

  

The application includes basic error handling for 404 and 500 errors using custom middleware.
